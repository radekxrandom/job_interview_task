# Test excercise

## Installation

First clone the repository

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/radekxrandom/job_interview_task
```

Afterwards we have to first install dependencies of the back-end and then start the server.

```console
$ cd back
$ yarn install
$ yarn run devstart
```

Now to run the client side:

```console
$ cd front
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

The app should start in your browser.
